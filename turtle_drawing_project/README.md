# Learning Turtle in Python 

The main.py file has code containing solutions to different challenges using the turtle module. 
The challenges are:
1. Make a square
2. Make a dashed line 
3. Create a triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon.... to decagon using random colors 
4. Generate a random turtle walk (along with creating random colors in turtle)
5. Make a spirograph 
6. Replicate a Hirst painting 

Each challenge is separated by a line of ###### 

# Just So You Know 

Some things may or may not be commented out or some things may not be in the 'proper' place.
I suggest running one challenge at a time while commenting out what is not needed for that time being. 
(eg. all of the different color lists and color functions, and the screen exit) 

This was a fun project to create and helped me understand Turtle and python language a little more.
